Hey there, I'm Max â€“ short for Maxwell Imo. Currently knee-deep in the world of Computer Information Technology, where I basically live and breathe tech stuff. Currently, you can find me doing things I enjoy doing when I'm not geeking out about IT and coding, like playing video games, watching anime, boxing, and building computers from the ground up. Yes, I am that person who can argue over the greatest anime series or blabber on and on about the newest gaming system. And here's the twist in the story: in approximately three months, I'm getting married! I'm beginning on the amazing journey of wedding preparation in addition to understanding virtual worlds and technological hurdles. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any tech-related questions you may have, anime suggestions, gaming ideas, or even any wedding survival advice.
